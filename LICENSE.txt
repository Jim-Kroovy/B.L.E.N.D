B.L.E.N.D (Blenders Life Easing Niche Developments) Blender Add-ons by James Goldsworthy (Jim Kroovy) and the licensing thereof.

There may be two licenses at play on any given add-on included in the B.L.E.N.D add-on collection.

**GNU GPL 3.0**
- All Python scripts used in Blender add-ons must have a GNU GPL compatible license. All the Python scripting in the add-on(s) have a GNU GPL 3.0 License.
- See [Sharing or selling Blender add-ons (Python scripts)](https://www.blender.org/about/license/) and [GNU GPL - 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)
- "Blenderâ€™s Python API is an integral part of the software, used to define the user interface or develop tools for example. The GNU GPL license therefore requires that such scripts (if published) are being shared under a GPL compatible license. You are free to sell such scripts, but the sales then is restricted to the download service itself. Your customers will receive the script under the same license (GPL), with the same free conditions as everyone has for Blender."
- *So you can do anything you like with my Python scripts but credit is greatly appreciated.*

**CC BY 4.0**
- All .blend files and their mesh, armature, material and texture contents and anything created with them have a CC BY 4.0 license. (Creative Commons - Attribution) 
- See [Creative Commons - CC BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
- "All CC licenses require that others who use your work in any way must give you credit the way you request, but not in a way that suggests you endorse them or their use. If they want to use your work without giving you credit or for endorsement purposes, they must get your permission first."
- "This license allows reusers to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format, so long as attribution is given to the creator. The license allows for commercial use."
- *Attribution conditions*
  - Do whatever you want with the .blend files but if you upload or distribute them (or any derivatives of them) you must give me credit. If you need special permissions please ask. I frequently give special permission for people using my products to create online storefront assets. (eg: The UE4 Marketplace, Blender Market, Flipped Normals, etc will require me to alter permissions so while the creator must credit me people who purchase the created assets do not have to) 
  - To give credit you must visibly state that the specific file(s) or add-on was created by Jim Kroovy and (if possible) provide links to my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/JimKroovy) and/or [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JimKroovy).
