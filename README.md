# B.L.E.N.D
(Blenders Life Easing Niche Developments) or B.L.E.N.D is a series of add-ons for  [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) aimed at making life a little easier, fixing common mistakes and generally filling in gaps that should maybe exist by default.

All of the stable add-ons should be pretty self explanatory from their tooltips but i will work on written guides for each of them.

I reserve my right to rename and re-organise and re-license everything as i see fit and i will not be doing backwards compatibility for previous versions of Blender.

Will fill in the contribution rules when i find the time.

# License Highlights:

Currently everything has a GPL license, credit is not required but greatly appreciated.
