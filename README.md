**Blenders Life Easing Niche Developments or B.L.E.N.D is a series of add-ons for [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) aimed at making life a little easier, solving common issues and generally filling in gaps that should maybe exist by default and adding features from other programs that Blender could do with.**

*This is a free project so please do not anticipate dedicated individual help unless you are supporting me financially. I will help where i can but only when i have the time.*

Check the [Wiki Pages](https://github.com/Jim-Kroovy/B.L.E.N.D/wiki) to find out more about the add-ons and see what's being worked on in the [Github Projects](https://github.com/Jim-Kroovy/B.L.E.N.D/projects)
