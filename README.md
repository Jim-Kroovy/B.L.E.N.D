# B.L.E.N.D
(Blenders Life Easing Niche Developments) or B.L.E.N.D is a series of add-ons for  [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) aimed at making life a little easier, fixing common mistakes and generally filling in gaps that should maybe exist by default.

All of the stable add-ons should be pretty self explanatory from their tooltips but i will work on written guides for each of them.

I reserve my right to rename and re-organise and re-license everything as i see fit and i will not be doing backwards compatibility for previous versions of Blender.

Will fill in the contribution rules and installation methods when i find the time.

## Support Development
(Please consider supporting financially! More help = more time i can put into updates, new features and support.)

- Donate to your chosen add-on on [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/jimkroovy) - Gives me a metric of which add-ons should get priority.
- Purchase the bundle on [Blender Market] (link coming soon!) - Gives the Blender Foundation 25% of profits.
- Support me on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/JimKroovy) - Gives you a discord server for feedback, ideas and help as well as giveaways.

## License Overview

**GNU GPL 3.0**
- All Python scripts used in Blender add-ons must have a GNU GPL compatible license. All the python scripting in the add-on(s) have a GNU GPL 3.0 License.
- See [Sharing or selling Blender add-ons (Python scripts)](https://www.blender.org/about/license/) and [GNU GPL - 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html)
- "Blenderâ€™s Python API is an integral part of the software, used to define the user interface or develop tools for example. The GNU GPL license therefore requires that such scripts (if published) are being shared under a GPL compatible license. You are free to sell such scripts, but the sales then is restricted to the download service itself. Your customers will receive the script under the same license (GPL), with the same free conditions as everyone has for Blender."
- *So you can do anything you like with my Python scripts but credit is greatly appreciated.*

- *Attribution conditions*
  - Do whatever you want with the .blend files but if you upload or distribute them (or any derivatives of them) you must give me credit. If you need special permissions please ask. I frequently give special permission for people using my products to create online storefront assets. (eg: The UE4 Marketplace, Blender Market, Flipped Normals, etc will require me to alter permissions so while the creator must credit me people who purchase the created assets do not have to) 
  - To give credit you must visibly state that the specific file(s) or add-on was created by Jim Kroovy and (if possible) provide links to my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/JimKroovy) and/or [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JimKroovy).
